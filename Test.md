**5. Software Risk Issues**

* **Integration Challenges:** Potential difficulties in integrating various components (payment gateways, shipping services, microservices).
* **Security Vulnerabilities:**  Risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and payment fraud.
* **Performance Bottlenecks:** Potential slowdowns or crashes under peak load, impacting user experience.
* **Usability Issues:**  Unclear user flows, complex navigation, or accessibility problems that could deter users. 
* **Data Integrity Issues:**  Risk of data corruption or inconsistency, leading to inaccurate information.

**6. Features to be Tested**

| Feature | Risk Level |
|---|---|
| User Registration & Login (Customer/Seller/Admin) | High |
| Product Browsing & Search | High |
| Product Listing (Seller) | High | 
| Shopping Cart Functionality | High |
| Checkout Process & Payment Integration | High |
| Order Management (Customer/Seller/Admin) | High |
| Inventory Management (Seller) | High |
| User Account Management  | Medium |
| Customer Support Features (Contact forms, FAQs) | Medium |
| Marketing & Promotional Features (Admin) | Medium |
| Reporting & Analytics (Seller/Admin) | Medium |

**7. Features Not to be Tested**

| Feature | Reason |
|---|---|
| Third-Party Integrations (Social Media Logins) |  Out of scope for initial release - will be tested in later iterations. |
| Mobile Application (iOS & Android) |  Not included in the current phase of development. |

**8. Approach**

**8.1 Testing Levels**

* **Unit Testing:** Conducted by developers to test individual components (functions, modules) in isolation. 
* **Integration Testing:** Verifies the interaction between different components of the system (e.g., API and database, microservices).
* **System Testing:**  Tests the entire system as a whole, simulating real-world user scenarios. 
* **Acceptance Testing:** Conducted by stakeholders (product owners, users) to determine if the system meets business requirements and user needs. 

**8.2 Testing Types**

* **Functional Testing:** Verifies that each feature works as expected based on requirements.
* **Usability Testing:** Evaluates the ease of use and overall user experience. 
* **Security Testing:** Identifies vulnerabilities and ensures data protection.
* **Performance Testing:** Assesses system speed, responsiveness, and stability under load.
* **Regression Testing:** Ensures that new changes haven't introduced new defects or broken existing functionality.

**8.3 Testing Tools**

* **Test Management Tool:**  [Jira] - for managing test cases, test cycles, and reporting.
* **API Testing Tool:**  [Postman, Insomnia] - for testing API endpoints. 
* **Web Automation Tool:** [Selenium] - for automating browser-based tests. 
* **Performance Testing Tool:** [JMeter] - for simulating user load and measuring performance. 
* **Security Testing Tools:** [Burp Suite]

**8.4 Test Environments**

* **Development:** Used by developers for continuous integration and testing.
* **Testing/QA:** Dedicated environment for integration, system, and acceptance testing. 
* **Staging:**  Mirrors the production environment for final testing and deployment rehearsals. 
* **Production:** The live environment accessible to real users.

**9. Item Pass/Fail Criteria**

* **Unit/Integration Testing:** 80% code coverage, all high-priority defects resolved.
* **System Testing:**  All test cases executed, 80% pass rate, all critical and high-priority defects resolved. 
* **Acceptance Testing:**  Business stakeholders approve the application for release based on pre-defined acceptance criteria. 

**10. Suspension Criteria and Resumption Requirements**

* **Suspension:** Testing will be suspended if:
    * The application becomes unstable, impacting further testing.
    * Critical defects block further progress. 
    * Major environmental issues arise.
* **Resumption:** Testing will resume once:
    * Blocking issues are resolved, and the environment is stable.
    * A new build is deployed, addressing critical defects.

**11. Test Deliverables**

* Master Test Plan document.
* Level-specific test plans (unit, integration, system, acceptance).
* Test cases and test scripts. 
* Test data.
* Test execution reports.
* Defect reports and resolution documentation.
* User acceptance sign-off. 

**12. Environmental Needs**

* Access to development, testing, and staging environments. 
* Test data creation tools or scripts.
* Test automation infrastructure (for UI and API testing).
* Network connectivity and bandwidth for performance testing.

**13. Staffing and Training Needs**

* **Test Team:** QA Engineers with experience in: 
    * Web application testing
    * API testing
    * Test automation
    * Performance testing
* **Training:** Team members will require training on:
    * ZestKart application features
    * The testing tools specified above (Selenium, JMeter, Postman etc.)

**14. Responsibilities**

* **Test Manager:**
    * Overall planning, execution, and reporting of testing activities.
    * Test team management and coordination.
    * Communication with stakeholders.
* **QA Engineers:**
    * Design, develop, and execute test cases.
    * Report defects and track their resolution. 
    * Contribute to test automation efforts.
* **Development Team:**
    * Fix defects identified by the testing team. 
    * Provide support for testing activities.


**15. Planning Risks and Contingencies**

| Risk | Contingency Plan | 
|---|---|
| Delays in development impacting testing schedule. | Adjust the testing schedule, prioritize critical features, and increase communication with the development team. | 
| Lack of skilled testing resources |  Outsource specific testing tasks or provide additional training. |
| Scope creep during testing  |  Clearly define acceptance criteria and manage changes through a formal change control process. |
