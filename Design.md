## ZestKart - Design Document

**1. Introduction**

**1.1 Purpose**

This document outlines the design specifications for the ZestKart e-commerce application. It translates the requirements outlined in the SRS and URD into a detailed technical plan, guiding the development team in building a robust, scalable, and user-friendly platform.

**1.2 Scope**

This document covers the high-level architectural design, database design, user interface (UI) design, and key technical decisions for ZestKart. It serves as a blueprint for the development process.

**2. Architectural Design**

**2.1 Overview**

ZestKart will be designed using a microservices architecture, promoting modularity, scalability, and maintainability. Key services will include:

* **User Service:**  Manages user accounts (customers, sellers, admins), authentication, and authorization.
* **Product Catalog Service:**  Handles product information, categories, search functionality, and inventory management.
* **Shopping Cart Service:**  Manages shopping cart functionality, including adding, removing, and updating items.
* **Order Service:**  Processes orders, manages payments, tracks order status, and handles shipping integration.
* **Notification Service:**  Handles email and potentially other forms of notifications to users (e.g., order updates, promotions).


**2.2 Technology Stack**

* **Programming Languages:**
    * **Backend (Microservices):** Python (with Flask or Django), Node.js (with Express), Java (with Spring Boot) 
    * **Frontend (Web Application):** JavaScript (with React, Vue, or Angular)
    * **Mobile Applications:**
        * **Android:** Kotlin (preferred) or Java
        * **iOS:** Swift (preferred) or Objective-C
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (for relational data) and potentially MongoDB or Cassandra (if there are use cases for NoSQL databases).
* **API Gateway:** Kong Gateway, Amazon API Gateway, or a similar solution to manage routing, authentication, and rate limiting for API requests.
* **Message Queue:** RabbitMQ or Kafka (for asynchronous communication between services, if needed). 
* **Caching:** Redis or Memcached (for caching frequently accessed data to improve performance).
* **Cloud Platform:** AWS, Google Cloud Platform, or Azure (depending on cost, features, and team familiarity).

**3. Database Design**

**3.1 Schema**

The database schema will be designed based on the ERD defined in the SRS. Key tables will include:

* **Users:** Stores user information (customers, sellers, admins).
* **Products:** Contains details about each product (name, description, price, images, etc.).
* **Categories:** Defines product categories and their hierarchy. 
* **Orders:** Stores order information (user, products, total amount, shipping address, etc.).
* **Payments:**  Tracks payment transactions.
* **Reviews:** Stores product reviews submitted by customers. 

**3.2 Data Consistency and Integrity**

* Implement database constraints (primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints) to ensure data integrity.
* Use transactions to ensure data consistency across multiple operations.
* Consider using a database abstraction layer (ORM) to simplify database interactions. 

**4. User Interface (UI) Design**

**4.1 Design Principles**

* **Clean and Modern:** A visually appealing and uncluttered design.
* **User-Friendly:** Intuitive navigation and clear call-to-actions.
* **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent look and feel throughout the application. 
* **Accessibility:** Adhere to accessibility standards (WCAG) for users with disabilities. 

**4.2 Key Screens and Functionality**

* **Homepage:** Featured products, categories, search bar.
* **Product Listing Page:**  Display products based on category or search, with filtering and sorting options.
* **Product Detail Page:**  Detailed information about a product, images, reviews, "Add to Cart" button.
* **Shopping Cart:** View and manage cart contents, proceed to checkout.
* **Checkout Process:** Securely capture shipping, billing, and payment information.
* **User Account:** Order history, account settings, wishlists.
* **Seller Dashboard:** Product management, order fulfillment, sales analytics.
* **Admin Dashboard:** User management, product catalog management, system settings. 


**5. Non-Functional Requirements**

**5.1 Performance**

* Implement caching (Redis or Memcached) to store frequently accessed data.
* Optimize database queries for speed and efficiency. 
* Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve static assets. 

**5.2 Security**

* **Authentication:**  Use secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT) to protect user accounts.
* **Authorization:**  Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access based on user roles.
* **Input Validation:**  Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities.
* **Data Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data (passwords, payment information) both in transit and at rest.

**5.3 Scalability**

* Design the system to be horizontally scalable, allowing you to add more servers to handle increased traffic.
* Use a cloud platform's auto-scaling features to automatically adjust resources based on demand.

**5.4 Availability**

* Implement redundancy measures (e.g., multiple database replicas, load balancers) to minimize downtime.
* Use a monitoring system to track application health and receive alerts.

**6. Development Process**

* **Agile Methodology:** Use an agile development methodology (e.g., Scrum) with short development sprints.
* **Version Control:** Use Git for version control.
* **Testing:** Implement a comprehensive testing strategy, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
* **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Automate the build, testing, and deployment processes.

**7. Maintenance and Support**

* Establish a process for monitoring the application for errors and performance issues. 
* Provide documentation and training to support staff. 
* Plan for regular updates and maintenance releases.

**8. Conclusion**

This design document provides a comprehensive plan for developing the ZestKart e-commerce application. By adhering to the principles and guidelines outlined in this document, the development team can build a robust, secure, and user-friendly platform that meets the needs of its users and achieves its business objectives.
